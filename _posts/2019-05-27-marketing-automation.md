<h2>What is Marketing Automation?</h2>

I would like to answer that question as basically as possible for you. There are many confusing answers.

Marketing Automation is a set of marketing tools (software) working together to automatically manage all of your marketing campaigns via email, social media, web sites, search engines, video and more.

Marketing automation is not only faster and, once set up, takes less time to manage, but also provides a more personalized experience if done right.

This does not mean that marketing automation replaces your marketing strategy but rather you should have a solid strategy that uses marketing automation to facilitate your strategy and makes it better. Your marketing automation should include not just acquiring new customers but also nurturing, onboarding, retaining and creating loyalty among your clients.
